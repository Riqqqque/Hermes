Hermes brings the max fps possible out of any other client. Especially with polygons.

Performance: Hermes is faster than optifine and the base sodium mod and also supports large server optimizations.

OptiFine features: Hermes supports most OptiFine features, including shaders, and zoom.

Minor Tweaks: Hermes includes minor tweaks that don't break the vanilla feel, fixes most common bugs, and utilities to diagnose crashes.

Works Everywhere: Hermes has no content mods, so it works on any world or server.

Up To Date: Hermes receives updates faster than the standard unkept modpack and is one of the first modpacks to upgrade to newer Minecraft versions.

Built on QUILT: Compared to Forge and Fabric, Quilt is more lightweight and faster than Fabric due to its development goal being more flexible than Fabric, updates and loads fast, and still has great mod support because every mod that works on fabric works on Quilt.

Support for MacOS: This modpacks fixes common bugs for MAC Apple Products so inputs are not bugged and the game is now playable.
